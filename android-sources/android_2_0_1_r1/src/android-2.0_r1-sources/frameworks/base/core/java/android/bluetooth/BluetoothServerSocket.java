/**
 * A listening Bluetooth socket.
 *
 * <p>The interface for Bluetooth Sockets is similar to that of TCP sockets:
 * {@link java.net.Socket} and {@link java.net.ServerSocket}. On the server
 * side, use a {@link BluetoothServerSocket} to create a listening server
 * socket. It will return a new, connected {@link BluetoothSocket} on an
 * accepted connection. On the client side, use the same
 * {@link BluetoothSocket} object to both intiate the outgoing connection,
 * and to manage the connected socket.
 *
 * <p>The most common type of Bluetooth Socket is RFCOMM. RFCOMM is a
 * connection orientated, streaming transport over Bluetooth. It is also known
 * as the Serial Port Profile (SPP).
 *
 * <p>Use {@link BluetoothDevice#createRfcommSocketToServiceRecord} to create
 * a new {@link BluetoothSocket} ready for an outgoing connection to a remote
 * {@link BluetoothDevice}.
 *
 * <p>Use {@link BluetoothAdapter#listenUsingRfcommWithServiceRecord} to
 * create a listening {@link BluetoothServerSocket} ready for incoming
 * connections to the local {@link BluetoothAdapter}.
 *
 * <p>{@link BluetoothSocket} and {@link BluetoothServerSocket} are thread
 * safe. In particular, {@link #close} will always immediately abort ongoing
 * operations and close the socket.
 *
 * <p>All methods on a {@link BluetoothServerSocket} require
 * {@link android.Manifest.permission#BLUETOOTH}
